The wav files were generated by Apple's Speech Synthesis Manager (say -v Fiona -o output.aiff) and were converted to .wav format with Audacity (http://www.audacityteam.org).

The file epic.mp3 used in the demo video was Epic Inspire Trailer by Alex Che, used under licence from Jamendo:

That file is not redistributed here. Feel free to use your own favourite soundtrack - any mp3 will work!
